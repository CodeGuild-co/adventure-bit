The program imports the conditions of rand and radio (Bluetooth in micro:bit). The program picks a random letter from 0-1 which selects whether it is selected as A or B. The program demands that the micro:bit displays the letter. The program then waits for user input from one of the two buttons (while loop). If the button press matches the button displayed, then the user gains a score. Otherwise an X is displayed. Our team attempted to make the program on the JavaScript code editor but it was too complex because we could not get the program to provide output while using JavaScript, for what we wanted to do and we switched to a python one.
Lore:
This game is set in a world where quiz show so always have the options A or B. In this world, the answer is always A or B.
