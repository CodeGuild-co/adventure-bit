## Welcome!

Members of the CodeGuild have been hard at work, making fun and very interactive games for the BBC micro:bit. This website documents their work.

You'll find links and descriptions for all of the games that the CodeGuild have created. As well as blog posts on how it was all acheived.

If you'd like to jump right in and start <strong>playing a game</strong> visit the [list page](/list/) and follow the instructions.

If you'd like to <strong>browse the code</strong> and see what's what, you'll find everything in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/CodeGuild-co/adventure-bit).

If you'd like to <strong>download the code</strong> then you can grab everything in one go using the download links at the top of the page. Or download each game individually from its page.
