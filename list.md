# All Games List

Each game is a bit different, but usually you play by choosing a game and then choosing the character you want to be. Download the character's `.hex` file and load it onto your micro:bit. Each game's page tells you how to play and how to get started. Enjoy!

Here are all of the games that we've created so far.
