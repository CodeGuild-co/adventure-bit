A Massively Multiplayer Offline Role-Playing Game.


## Improvements

Here's a list of things that could be done to make this package better.

- Make it work!
    - Memory limitations really kicked this game towards the end. Maybe re-write to be lean?
    - Comms might be faulty?
- Better bosses
    - More interesting attack patterns (e.g. go for the tank?)
    - More interesting attacks (e.g. mix up AoE vs roflstomp)
- Better warrior
    - Require an action to bump up defense rating?
    - Implement threat?
- Better mage
    - Mage is pretty good right now, but make it work?
- Add priest
    - Healer class
