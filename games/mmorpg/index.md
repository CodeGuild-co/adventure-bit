## Diary

This game was built by the wonderful [mdaudali](https://github.com/mdaudali), [2j2-1](https://github.com/2j2-1), [DanielHudson217](https://github.com/DanielHudson217), [Steven-Hails](https://github.com/Steven-Hails), and [woodruffepeacockw](https://github.com/woodruffepeacockw) during the November 2016 [Villiers Park](http://www.villierspark.org.uk/) Computer Science Residential.

This package pre-dates this website, so unfortunately, the team didn't get the opportunity to write any diary entries for this game.

The scope and ambition of this game is huge! It's so exciting! Unfortunately, technical issues plagued the team's progress and currently, the game is unplayable.
