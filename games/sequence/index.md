# Sequence Game
As part of the Villier Park Computer Science course we have made a small game on the BBC:MicroBit.
This allowed us to learn about how the Microbit works to build a better game afterwards - Microbattle.

The [Src folder](/games/sequence/dist/src/sequence.py) has the source code of the game in python commented to allow developers to understand 
The [Readme.md](games/sequence/readme.md) shows more advanced instructions on how the game works as well as possible improvement we could have done

# Installation

To play the game simply download the game in the [dist folder](/games/sequence/dist/sequence.hex) and simply transfer it to the storage of your Microbit.
To test the game only one MicroBit is needed however to play the game two MicroBit are needed to compare scores

# Playing the game
- The game will display a letter that it wants you to press either A or B.
- If you press the correct letter then you will score a point.
- If you don't press the correct letter then you won't you score any points.
- The winner is whoever has the most points at the end of the round.
- The round ends when each player has hit all 5 letters in their sequence.
- If both points are the same, then this is a draw.
