# Sequence Game
As part of the Villier Park Computer Science course we have made a small game on the BBC:MicroBit.
This allowed us to learn about how the Microbit works to build a better game afterwards - Microbattle.

To play the game simply download the game in the [dist folder](/games/sequence/dist/sequence.hex) and simply transfer it to the storage of your Microbit.
Run the game on two Microbits to play

The [Src folder](/games/sequence/dist/src/sequence.py) has the source code of the game in python commented to allow developers to understand 
The [Readme.md](games/sequence/readme.md) shows more advanced instructions on how the game works as well as possible improvement we could have done
